@ Programming Environment

@English Version
This camera calibration program was developed and executed within a Python 3.13 environment.
The core computations and data handling rely on several key open-source libraries:
@note NumPy
@note Pandas
@note Standard Python Libraries: Math, OS

The development occurred in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) common for Python: PyCharm

No specialized or proprietary libraries were required, making the environment easily reproducible.
The library versions used would ideally be recent stable releases at the time of development to ensure compatibility and access to current features,
though the code primarily relies on long-standing functionalities of these libraries.

@note Standard Python Libraries: Math, OS

该程序在Python 集成开发环境（IDE）中开发的--PyCharm
该程序不依赖任何专门的或专有的库，因此环境易于复现。
所使用的库版本理想情况下应为开发时的最新稳定版本，以确保兼容性并能使用最新功能，尽管代码主要依赖于这些库的长期稳定功能。
